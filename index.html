	<p style="text-align: center; margin-left:130px; margin-right: 130px; margin-top:30px; text-align: justify;"><bold style="font-weight: bold; font-size:20px;">Statement From Advisor:</bold> Uzma Haque Syeda has fulfilled her paper requirement through the publication of the paper “Design Study "Lite" Methodology: Expediting Design Studies and Enabling the Synergy of Visualization Pedagogy and Social Good” in the proceedings of ACM CHI (Computer-Human Interaction) 2020 (AR 24%). This exceptional research was also recognized at CHI 2020 with a Best Paper Award, only given to <1% of accepted conference papers. Uzma is the first author of the paper, and was the project lead on the paper including meta-analysis, data gathering, theory creation, and validation to the final paper composition. Although the paper is based on my multiple years of teaching, all the novel contributions of the paper including theory contributions (“Design Study Lite Methodology”), meta-analysis, validation, and curriculum replication materials were all original work and insight by Uzma. The process of designing and validating this new theory (process model) involved extensive data gathering and analysis, critical thinking, and evaluation. All of this work was planned, organized, and conceived by Uzma and primarily executed by Uzma.  Throughout this project she demonstrated independent research motivation, critical thinking, strategy, and problem solving. This work solidly demonstrates Uzma’s ability to be an independent successful researcher and complete her dissertation.</p>
